# WaterReminder2
completed app which reminds the user via notification, to drink some water. Notifications only occur if the phone is being charged.This app was built as part of Udacity's Developing Android Apps course.


Future ideas: change the app so that instead of reminding the user to drink some water, it instead reminds the user to take a screen break and get some exercise.
